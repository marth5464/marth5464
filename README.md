A) A short into

When i was younger, i was that kid you paid to drip down your myspace for $10. After awhile of school though i burnt my interest out and moved on to my regular studies.
At first I didn't think I would ever be good enough to make something. back then working with only notepad, on my schools computer lab. It felt like i was miles from writing anything usuable or meaningful.
But now that I'm a bit older, i realize my mindset was all wrong. i don't need to think of coding as a craft in which i make something.
But quickly and effectively memorizing a set of tools to solve a problem.
